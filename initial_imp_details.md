# Initial Implementation Questions & Details

## Clarifying Questions

### 1. LLM Integration
- **OpenAI API Key**: Do you have an OpenAI API key ready, or should I set up a placeholder for now?
- **LLM Model**: Which OpenAI model should we use? (gpt-3.5-turbo, gpt-4, etc.) Use your own discretion to pick the best model based on the spec.
- **Rate Limiting**: Any concerns about API costs/rate limits for the MVP? Let's code forward-thinking -- build logic for a rate limit but do not set one for now.

### 2. UI/UX Preferences
- **Styling Framework**: Any preference for CSS framework? (Tailwind, styled-components, plain CSS) Tailwind
- **Color Scheme**: Any specific color preferences? (light/dark mode, brand colors, etc.) Light mode with pastel colors
- **Responsive Design**: Should this be mobile-first, desktop-first, or both? Desktop-first
- **Accessibility**: Any specific accessibility requirements? Basic accessibility (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation)

### 3. Data Persistence
- **Storage**: Should we use localStorage for MVP, or do you want a backend database? localStorage for MVP
- **Data Export**: Do you want users to be able to export their data? Not for MVP
- **Data Backup**: Any backup/restore functionality needed? Not for MVP

### 4. Features & Functionality
- **Goal Types**: Should we support different types of goals (personal, professional, health, etc.)? Generic goals for MVP
- **Progress Tracking**: How granular should progress tracking be? (daily, weekly, custom intervals) Free-form journal entries
- **Notifications**: Any reminder/notification system needed? Not for MVP
- **Sharing**: Should users be able to share goals or progress? Not for MVP

### 5. AI Integration
- **Progress Analysis**: How should the AI analyze progress? (sentiment, keywords, structured data) Natural language analysis
- **Coaching Style**: What tone should the AI coach have? (encouraging, direct, analytical) Encouraging but direct
- **Suggestion Frequency**: How often should the AI provide suggestions? On each journal entry
- **Context Memory**: Should the AI remember previous entries for context? Yes, last 3-5 entries

## Technical Decisions Made

### Architecture
- **Framework**: Next.js 14 with App Router
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **State Management**: React useState/useEffect
- **API**: Next.js API routes

### Data Structure
```typescript
interface Goal {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  description?: string;
  currentProgress?: string;
  context?: string;
  overallProgress: number; // 0-100
  createdAt: string;
  updatedAt: string;
}

interface ProgressUpdate {
  id: string;
  goalId: string;
  journalEntry: string;
  timestamp: string;
  llmResponse?: LLMProgressResponse;
}

interface LLMProgressResponse {
  overall_progress: number;
  progress_increase: number;
  reasoning: string;
  feedback: string;
}
```

### API Endpoints
- `POST /api/progress` - Analyze journal entry and update progress
- `POST /api/coaching` - Get AI coaching advice

### Key Features
1. **Goal Creation**: Simple form with title, description, current progress, context
2. **Progress Updates**: Journal-style entries with AI analysis
3. **AI Coaching**: Strategic advice and milestone suggestions
4. **Dashboard**: Visual progress tracking with goal cards
5. **Local Storage**: Client-side data persistence

### AI Integration
- **Model**: GPT-4 for better reasoning and context understanding
- **System Prompts**: Carefully crafted prompts for consistent behavior
- **Error Handling**: Fallback responses when AI is unavailable
- **Cost Optimization**: Efficient prompt design and response parsing

### UI/UX Design
- **Style**: Soft & friendly with subtle color pop
- **Layout**: Desktop-focused with responsive elements
- **Navigation**: Tab-based (Goals, Journal, Coaching)
- **Feedback**: Real-time AI responses with loading states
- **Accessibility**: Basic ARIA labels and keyboard navigation

## Implementation Notes

### Security
- API keys stored in environment variables
- No sensitive data in client-side code
- Input validation on all API endpoints

### Performance
- Client-side rendering for fast interactions
- Optimized API calls with proper error handling
- Efficient state management with React hooks

### Scalability
- Modular component architecture
- Reusable utility functions
- Clean separation of concerns
- Easy to extend with new features

## Next Steps
1. Set up development environment
2. Implement core components
3. Integrate OpenAI API
4. Add data persistence
5. Test and refine AI responses
6. Deploy to production
